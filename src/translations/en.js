    products_strap_1_desc: "A diving mask strap is a strap used to secure the mask firmly to the diver's face, a key piece of diving equipment for comfort and safety underwater. Neoprene straps are often chosen for their width, softness and less likelihood of slipping through hair, minimizing the risk of hair pulling. They are typically wider than standard straps, which helps evenly distribute pressure on the back of the head and prevents discomfort during prolonged diving.",
    products_strap_2_desc: "We produce straps with an adjustment mechanism that allows you to adjust the length of the strap to the circumference of the diver's head. This keeps the mask firmly and securely seated on the face, preventing water intrusion. The adjustment straps are available in different colors according to the customer's needs. Made of durable material and solidly attached to the strap, they ensure long product life. We can also produce adjustment straps in different colors upon request.",
